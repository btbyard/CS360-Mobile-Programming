Mobile Developement

I designed an app that tracked users weight. It allows user to enter their current weight, and also their goal weight. 
The app then shows the user how many pounds they must lose or gain to reach their goal. 
The app congratulates user when goal is reached. 
The app allows user to look at past entries and on what date it was entered. 

I ended up having 7 layout screens listed below. Each screen was needed to show user different things. I thought my app was pretty
user friendly in the way in naviagets between layouts. I tried to put a home button on most screens to that routed ytou back to the
home screen. 

activity_enter_current_weight ---- User entered curent weight here

activity_enter_weight         ---- User entered goal weight here

activity_home_screen          ---- Home screen after login

activity_login                ---- Login after user registered

activity_main                 ---- App opens here where user can login or register

activity_s_m_s                ---- seperate screen to sign up for SMS messaging  

activity_weight_history       ---- seperate screen to enter, update, or delete into memory database

Zybooks helped me a lot with coding methods and procedures, but I also used a lot of youtube and google for things I didn't know
A programmer once told me a good programmer is a master googler. 

One think I used that was important was using database setup with a DBHelper class that saved data even after app has been closed. 

I tested my code by trying to enter things wrong and see what happens. For example, if I enter wront login credentials, 
The app displays a message that says "user not registered." 

I had to inovate it the way some of my layout were set up, and how they pass data to another class. 

I was really proud of my home screen and how the layout looks, and the navigation to other screens and back from there.
